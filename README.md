So I was working on the code on Friday, everything seemed to work out fine, but then it seems like today, when I want to modify a little bit cuz I didn't finish it looks like it didn't correct itself, for some error happened with the Java effect. It looks like I can't fix it. I'm sorry, I'm just going to tell you the truth. I don't know what went wrong, and you know how it is sometimes, you just need to leave the code if it works, don't touch it. That's also the reason why I can provide screenshots because I can't take a screenshot of it it just shows me an error which is kind of irritating because it was working all fine and dining on Friday I don't know what I did wrong and trying to fix it and it's not going well for me.

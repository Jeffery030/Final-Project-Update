As of right now, the three classes that I have are the vehicle part and maintenance setup. So I'll start with the vehicle, the vehicle pretty much stores parts of the vehicle, and identifies also what is due for maintenance. part stores information about certain parts and calculates when they're due for a change. And last but not least, the maintenance has pretty much it is to manage multiple vehicles and kind of keeps their data reserved in the code as well.
